                        What is it?
                    </b>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The bacteria in Rhodofeast are Rhodopseudomonas palustris.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            R. palustris is an extremely ancient purple non-sulfur bacterium (PNSB).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It is flagellated and can swim among the bacterioplankton but can also attach to a substrate 
                            and form biofilms. Swimming cells can join films, but not vice versa.4. Like most PNSB, 
                            this species is facultatively anaerobic. Especially compared to other PNSB, it proliferates 
                            easily in the presence of oxygen but nevertheless prefers anaerobic conditions.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Because it can utilize all four major modes of metabolisms, R. palustris is regarded as among 
                            the most versatile organisms on Earth. It often uses light as a source of energy and organic 
                            matter as a source of carbon (photoheterotrophy). It can also function as a complete photoautotroph 
                            like algae or as a complete organoheterotroph like an animal.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Like many of its closest relatives (the rhizobial bacteria), it is a nitrogen fixer (i.e., diazotroph). 
                            That is, it can use N2 to form ammonium which is used to build its body.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It can perform photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation only in anaerobic environments.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <b>
                        Why does it matter to reef aquarists?
                    </b>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            R. palustris occurs widely in nature (including on coral reefs).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It forms a close relationship with zooxanthellate corals, living in anaerobic areas within the hostâ€™s mucus 
                            and tissues.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In this relationship, the bacteria provides a source of biologically available nitrogen to the zooxanthellae; 
                            in turn, the bacteria consume dissolved organic matter leached from both the coral and zooxanthellae. These 
                            interactions serve to nourish the coral as well as eliminate organic waste products.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Rhizobial bacteria are so beneficial to corals that corals selectively take them up. Corals alter the 
                            content of their mucus in order to attract and pamper these microbes. Consequently, densities of 
                            nitrogen-fixing bacteria are often 400x greater in the mucus than in the surrounding water.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Coral biologists now credit this symbiosis between zooxanthellate corals and these bacteria as the 
                            reason reef ecosystems can be so productive in such oligotrophic (i.e., nutrient-poor) waters.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Using the natural probiotic activity of these bacteria, reef aquarists can enjoy the benefits of a 
                            ULN system (e.g., no nuisance algae) while also enjoying excellent coral health/growth.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Coral farmers have a lot to gain from these microbes. While their purchase price is low, and the 
                            investment of time dosing them is minimal, the potential for increased coral yield is substantial. 
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <b>
                        Are there any other benefits to using it?
                    </b>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Just as corals feed on their zooxanthellae, they also feed on these bacteria. In addition to its probiotic qualities, R. palustris is an excellent coral food. It is rich in protein (>70%) and provides essential fatty acids (e.g., stearic acid and oleic acid). It contains beneficial carotenoids such as astaxanthin. And, because it lacks a cellulose-based cell wall, it is more digestible than phytoplankton.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            R. palustris synthesizes the antibiotic streptomycin, which has been demonstrated in many cases to inhibit Vibrio (Vibrio is a common and deadly coral pathogen).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            By increasing feed conversion rates, corals (and other animals that consume these microbes) generate less wasteâ€“leading to cleaner water.
                        </li>
