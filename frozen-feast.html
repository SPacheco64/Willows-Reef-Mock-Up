                    Shelf-stable natural bacterium (B. subtilis and B. lichenformis) are used in conjunction because they 
                    germinate under slightly different conditions, e.g., salinity and temperature, giving the user a better 
                    range of rearing environments when using the product. 
                    <br><br>
                    Both species of bacillus are used to reduce metabolites, primarily NH4 and H2S. Putative benefits include 
                    reduced water exchange, lower levels of blue green algae, lower ammonia levels, less stress on animals, 
                    resulting in less disease. Mix this with our live direct feed probiotics and you get the ultimate food. 
                    Info on the probiotics This is a live probiotic. The bacteria in this product are cultured in a specific 
                    manner that makes them adapted to colonizing the animal gut. Their express purpose is to provide nutritional 
                    and immunological benefits to the fish, corals and other animals that consume them. It's sold in a smaller 
                    bottle, but a this is a nicer bottle with precision dropper, so one can administer small doses (in food) this 
                    is made specifically for use as a probiotic. There are a couple products out there that claim to contain 
                    probiotic bacteria. But those are dry (inactive) cultures of sketchy genera such as Lactobacillus which 
                    typically are not used because they're the best, but because they are cheap. 
                    <br><br>
                    These bacteria (Rhodopseudomonas) are live, viable and are proven to increase feed conversion in captive fish. 
                    It is also a widely known coral-associated probiotic. We spend a lot more time/money to culture these on a 
                    polyphenolic food source, which essentially means that they are adapted to breaking down recalcitrant organic 
                    substances like cellulose, in other words herbivores like tangs ultimately digest more of their food and generate 
                    less solid waste. Throw in the fact that these bacteria are also rich in carotenoids, and there really isn't even 
                    a comparison to the very few other true aquacultural probiotic products available in our industry.
